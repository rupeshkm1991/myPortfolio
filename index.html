                Application development is the process of developing computer programs to accomplish a variety of tasks
                a company may need. Businesses use applications to automate processes and increase efficiency in a
                variety of ways, from calculating monthly expenses to scheduling sales reports. An app’s development
                follows these steps: gather requirements, create prototypes, test, implement, and integrate.

                User interface (UI) design is the process designers use to build interfaces in software or
                computerized devices, focusing on looks or style. Designers aim to create interfaces which users
                find easy to use and pleasurable. UI design refers to graphical user interfaces and other
                forms—e.g., voice-controlled interfaces.
